# Movie Box

This is my first project using React. I also used Scss and made it fully responsive.
This project is entirely for Front-End learning porpuses.

All the data is from the MOVIE DATABASE API at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3


Here are some screenshots of the website:

It's deployed with netlify at https://movieboxreact.netlify.app/
